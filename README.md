I am makeing a calculator here are the steps that need to happen.

I need the numbers 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.

These will all be buttons.

The input should show in a box.

2 input boxes in the middle a opperator.

4 buttons */-+

If I hit a button the corresponding number should apear in the inout box.

I will have the following operators *,/,-,+,=. They will all be buttons.

Once I hit any of the buttons it should put all of the previous input into an array and save it as a string.

based on the operator that was clicked it will be inputed into that specific corresponding array/function.
the next input will be made into a string as well. once the equals sign it clicked it will calculated and delete the inputed values and the final result will be placed on the screen.
